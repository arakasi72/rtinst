## rtinst

#### 30 Second Guide

Ubuntu and Debian Seedbox Installation

Download and run setup (if logged in directly as root, do not need to use sudo)

	sudo bash -c "$(wget --no-check-certificate -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arakasi72/rtinst/master/rtsetup)"

and then to run the main script, ([check the options you can use](https://github.com/arakasi72/rtinst/wiki/Guide#21-main-script-options)):

	sudo rtinst

It takes about 10 minutes to run, depending on your server setup. After you have run the script and everything is working, I suggest a reboot, the script does not automate this reboot, you need to do it manually using the reboot command.
