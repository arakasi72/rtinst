####0. 30 Second Guide

Download script

	cd /tmp && wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arakasi72/rtinst/master/rtinst.sh

and then to run it:

	screen sudo bash rtinst.sh

**IMPORTANT: NOTE THE NEW SSH PORT AND MAKE SURE YOU CAN SSH INTO YOUR SERVER BEFORE CLOSING THE EXISTING SESSION**



####1. Introduction
Seedbox installation

It has been tested with clean installs of: 

	Ubuntu 12
	Ubuntu 13
	Ubuntu 14
	Ubuntu 15
	Ubuntu 16
	Debian 7
	Debian 8

Services that will be installed and configured are

	1. vsftpd - ftp server
	2. libtorrent/rtorrent
	3. rutorrent
	4. Nginx (webserver)
	5. autodl-irssi
	6. webmin (optional see section 3.7 below)

It takes about 10 minutes to run, depending on your server setup.

After you have run the script and everything is working, I suggest a reboot, the script does not automate this reboot, you need to do it manually using the reboot command.

####[2. Main Script](rtinst.sh)

Run the script from root, or if you have a sudo user already set up you can run it from there. If for some reason it is interrupted you can run it again to completion. Running the script multiple times will not cause any problems.

First download the script:

	wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arakasi72/rtinst/master/rtinst.sh

and then to run it:

	bash rtinst.sh

or if you run it from a non-root sudo user:

	sudo bash rtinst.sh

If you run it with the -d option it will enable https downloads, and provide web access to your home directory for https downloads:

	bash rtinst.sh -d

if you run it with -l option it will create the rtinst.log file with detailed output. 

	bash rtinst.sh -l


The script will assign a random ssh port for security purposes. It will display this on the screen when it has finished running and write it to ~/rtinst.info

if you run it with -t option however it will set the ssh port to the standard 22. 

	bash rtinst.sh -t

**IMPORTANT: NOTE THE NEW SSH PORT AND MAKE SURE YOU CAN SSH INTO YOUR SERVER BEFORE CLOSING THE EXISTING SESSION**

For security the script assigns ftp to a random port number. You will need to use this port number in your ftp client. It will display the port number at the end of the script, and will also write it to ~/rtinst.info

The script assigns a random rutorrent password, to reset it, logged in as the rutorrent user type into the terminal rtpass

To access that information just use the following command

	cat ~/rtinst.info

####3. Admin Scripts

A number of additional scripts will be installed that carry out a variety of useful functions. These will be installed by the main script. So you don't need to remember all the script names you can run rtadmin which will, present a menu to launch the other scripts listed in this section. 

	sudo rtadmin

If you get an error run the following, you will only need to this once, and subsequently the prior command will work

	wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arakasi72/rtinst/master/scripts/rtgetscripts
	sudo bash rtgetscripts
