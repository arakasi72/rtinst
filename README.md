## rtinst

#### 30 Second Guide

Ubuntu and Debian Seedbox Installation

Download script

	wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windscolorme/rtinst/master/rtinst.sh

and then to run it, ([check the options you can use here](https://github.com/arakasi72/rtinst/wiki/Guide#21-main-script-options)):

	sudo bash rtinst.sh

It takes about 10 minutes to run, depending on your server setup. After you have run the script and everything is working, I suggest a reboot, the script does not automate this reboot, you need to do it manually using the reboot command.
